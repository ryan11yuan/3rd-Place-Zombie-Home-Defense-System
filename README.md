# Zombie Home Defense System
The Zombie Home Defense System uses the mediapipe API to retrieve information on a person's joint locations. By using these coordinates, the system produces a percentage that represents how human they are. The system has a threshold that declares the person in the camera a human or a zombie depending on the percentage that it produces. Finally, these percentages are uploaded to the leaderboard website so that people can compare their scores with others. 

This project won us 3rd place at the Apocalypse hackathon.
